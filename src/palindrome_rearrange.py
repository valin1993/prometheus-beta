    Determines if the characters in the given string can be rearranged to form a palindrome.

    A palindrome can be formed if at most one character has an odd count,
    and all other characters have even counts.

        s (str): The input string to check for palindrome rearrangement possibility.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the string's characters can be rearranged to form a palindrome, False otherwise.

    Examples:
        >>> can_form_palindrome("racecar")
        True
        >>> can_form_palindrome("aab")
