    Check if a given number is a perfect number.
    
    A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors 
    (excluding the number itself). For example, 6 is a perfect number because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

        ValueError: If the input is not a positive integer.
